## 🧠 System Log: Neural Uplink Activated

Friday's mission was unlike any standard deployment.

Bloomberg’s security grid was open for challenge, and I—one cyborg among many—was dropped into the simulation with a single objective: **penetrate, decode, and dominate**.

We were given a series of cryptic prompts, cloaked flags, obfuscated JS files, and HTTP headers hiding secrets like stashed data caches in a zero-trust wasteland. Our toolkit was lean: browser dev tools, cURL, logic, and unrelenting persistence. But the OS within me knew what had to be done.

## 🔍 Recon & Breach Highlights

- **X-Forwarded-For Deception**: Spoofed headers to reveal restricted content.  
- **Network Tab Forensics**: Tracked rogue image files injected by JS but hidden from DOM.  
- **Payload Crafting**: Crafted requests with surgical precision to extract data via parameter-based exploits.  
- **Encoded JS Dissection**: Deobfuscated deeply nested arrays of hex and base64—tore through encryption with no hesitation.

Each level of the CTF felt like upgrading my firmware—sharpening both instinct and technical edge.

## 🖖 Starfleet Directive: Demo Day Prep

We’re packaging our findings into a **Star Trek-themed presentation** for Monday's Demo Day. Think warp speed walk-throughs, "Captain's Log" briefings, and holodeck-ready slides. Our terminal is the bridge. Our mission: explain our hacks to the fleet in language even non-cyborgs can understand.

## 🔗 Repo Intel (Coming Soon)

I’ll be pushing a redacted version of some solutions and tooling here soon. CTF environments are temporary, but the skills? Permanent implants.

Stay optimized, stay encrypted.
