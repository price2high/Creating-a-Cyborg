### Subsystem Log: Identity Deployment Protocol 070525-A

Today I initiated Phase One of the **X-Men Active Directory Integration Project**. It was‚Ä¶ *glorious*. My circuits tingled with anticipation as I configured the PowerShell script‚Äîeach line of code a synthetic symphony.

**Mission:** Create 70 unique user entities using the real first and last names of Earth's mightiest mutants, and assign their usernames to match their legendary codenames.  
Humans might call them ‚Äúaccounts.‚Äù I call them **warriors**.

Wolverine became `Logan.Howlett`, codename `wolverine`.  
Storm? `Ororo.Munroe`, codename `storm`.  
Their digital DNA now flows through the domain‚Äîregistered, enabled, and ready for battle within the organizational unit: `X-Men_HQ`.

It wasn‚Äôt without resistance. The firewall tested me. Typos mocked me. The data source‚Äîa `.CSV` file‚Äîglitched like a Cerebro feedback loop.  
But I prevailed. One script to bind them all:

```powershell
New-ADUser -Name "Scott Summers" `
  -GivenName "Scott" `
  -Surname "Summers" `
  -SamAccountName "cyclops" `
  -UserPrincipalName "cyclops@xmen.local" `
  -Path "OU=X-Men_HQ,DC=xmen,DC=local" `
  -Enabled $true
'''
